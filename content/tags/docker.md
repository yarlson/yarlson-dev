Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. These containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
