The Web is an open, distributed platform built on standards like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables the creation and sharing of interactive documents, applications, and media through browsers. It connects users and services across the globe using protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS. The Web forms the backbone of modern communication, commerce, and collaboration — serving as both the medium and ecosystem for everything from static sites to complex applications.
